        about={"Prudential Center is a multi-purpose indoor arena in the central business district of Newark, New Jersey, United States. It was designed by HOK Sport (now Populous), with the exterior designed by Morris Adjmi Architects. Opened in 2007, it is the home of the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League (NHL) and the men's basketball program of Seton Hall University, known as the Seton Hall Pirates. The arena officially seats 16,514 patrons for hockey games and up to 18,711 for basketball. Fans and sports writers have affectionately nicknamed the arena \"The Rock\" in reference to the Rock of Gibraltar, the corporate logo of Prudential Financial, a financial institution that owns the naming rights to the arena and is headquartered within walking distance of it."}
        thingstoknow={"Besides hosting sporting events for the New Jersey Devils or Seton Hall University, the Prudential Center holds a plethora of other types of events. Other sporting events, such as for wrestling, gymnastics, and boxing, have been hosted by the center. Additionally, concerts take place in the facility often, with some past musicians including Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi, and The Eagles."}
        covid={"As a result of the Executive Order from the City of Newark on March 2, effective immediately and unless required otherwise by the artist or promoter of a particular show, guests will no longer be required to show proof of vaccination or proof of a negative test to enter Prudential Center and will not be required to wear face masks to attend events. However, anyone who wishes to do so can still wear a mask."}
        addInfo={"Bags are not permitted inside of Prudential Center. The only exceptions are soft sided clutches/purses/wallets under 4” x 7” with a shoulder strap or wrist strap attached, and medical or childcare bags under 12” x 16” x 6”. Patrons with exceptions should enter at the Ford Tower or the Lafayette Street entrance and expect to have their bags X-rayed. Bags that do not meet these expectations must be returned to the guest’s vehicle or stored in a Prudential Center supplied locker at the guest’s expense."} />
