        about={"With the Manhattan skyline, Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island as a spectacular backdrop, Liberty State Park is one of the state's most dramatic parks. A green oasis in the heart of Metropolitan northern New Jersey, Liberty State Park serves as the gateway to the region’s rich natural, cultural and historical resources.\nThe historic Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal (CRRNJ), a grand setting for much of New Jersey's transportation history in the northeast, sits prominently at the north end of the park. A two-mile promenade, Liberty Walk links two picnic and playground areas, the Nature Center and the CRRNJ Terminal while presenting visitors with a sweeping view of the Hudson River. Wide open fields, miles of pathways and an outdoor performance area provide an inviting atmosphere for all types of recreation."}
        thingstoknow={"The park features a multitude of activities and its visitors' and interpretive centers provide historical background information. There is boating and canoeing on the Hudson River and New York Bay, plus picnic areas, a playground, food concessions, areas for fishing and crabbing and a marina. The park also features trails for hiking, biking, nature walks and fitness and it's the site of spectacular Fourth of July fireworks."}
